💻 Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to build a predictive model to estimate laptop prices using key features such as RAM, SSD, CPU, Brand, and GPU. It leverages real-world data and advanced regression models to understand the key pricing factors and deliver high-accuracy predictions.

🚀 Project Objectives
Predict laptop prices using historical configuration and pricing data.

Analyze the impact of individual components (RAM, SSD, Brand, etc.) on pricing.

Identify gaps in model performance for high-end vs budget segments.

Build a ready-to-deploy module for integration with price recommendation systems.

🔍 Key Insights
RAM, SSD, and Brand are the most influential features.

Brand perception affects price strategy dynamically over time.

High-end models showed slightly lower accuracy due to data imbalance.

📊 Model Performance
Model	R² Score (No Outliers)	RMSE (No Outliers)
Gradient Boosting	0.8227	13,510

With Outliers: R² = 0.8053, RMSE = 14,829

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python (pandas, NumPy, sklearn, matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Data Preprocessing (encoding, outlier handling, scaling)

📦 Deliverables
📈 High accuracy price prediction model

💡 Insights into pricing drivers

📦 Deployment-ready script

📉 Comparative performance analysis

🔮 Future Improvements
Incorporate real-time data sources for continuous learning.

Add visual dashboards using Streamlit or Power BI.

Expand dataset to include more rare laptop configurations.

📌 About the Dataset
Laptop features include brand, CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, and screen resolution.

Prices vary based on feature combinations and brand perception.
